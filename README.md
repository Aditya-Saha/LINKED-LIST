# LINKED-LIST
Objective: Realization of Singly Linked List operations. Multi-level menu design &amp; Modular programming. Problem Statement:
Write a multi level Menu Driven program in C to perform the following operations on Singly Linked-List.
Assume that, the Linked-List may be Unordered or Ordered. Use a variable to indicate the Linked-List is ordered or unordered with the value 
 0 means un-ordered List 
 1 means the List is arranged in ascending order. 
 2 means the List is arranged in descending order. 
1. Display the content of the Linked-List along with node address. 
2. Insert a value into the Linked-List as per the order/ un-order. 
In case of un- ordered list do the followings:
        1. Prepend 2. Append 3. After a specific given value 4. Before a specific given value 5. After the maximum value of the list 6. Before the minimum value of the list 
3. Search a value in the Linked-List as per the order/ un-order.
4. Search the number of occurrences of a given value from the Linked-List, store the results(node addresses) in another linked list. 
5. Delete a given value from the Linked-List as per the order/ un-order.
6. Delete minimum value from the Linked-List(only for un-ordered list) 
7. Remove all repeated occurrence from the Linked-List. 
8. Concatenation of two un-ordered Linked List.
9. Merge of two un-ordered Linked List.
10. Randomize an ordered list.
11. Reverse the Linked-List.
